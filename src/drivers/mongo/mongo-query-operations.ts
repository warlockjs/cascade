/**
 * Helper class for constructing MongoDB aggregation pipeline operations.
 *
 * This class encapsulates the logic for creating operation objects that will be
 * converted to MongoDB aggregation stages by the query parser. It provides a
 * clean abstraction over the low-level operation structure, making the query
 * builder code more maintainable and testable.
 *
 * Each operation consists of:
 * - **stage**: The MongoDB aggregation stage name (e.g., "$match", "$project")
 * - **type**: An internal identifier for the operation type
 * - **payload**: The data associated with the operation
 * - **mergeable**: Whether this operation can be merged with adjacent similar operations
 *
 * @internal This class is for internal use within the MongoDB driver
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const operations: Operation[] = [];
 * const helper = new MongoQueryOperations(operations);
 *
 * // Add a match operation
 * helper.addMatchOperation("whereIn", { field: "status", values: ["active", "pending"] });
 *
 * // Add a project operation
 * helper.addProjectOperation("select", { fields: ["name", "email"] });
 *
 * // Operations array is now populated
 * console.log(operations);
 * // [
 * //   { stage: "$match", mergeable: true, type: "whereIn", payload: {...} },
 * //   { stage: "$project", mergeable: true, type: "select", payload: {...} }
 * // ]
 * ```
